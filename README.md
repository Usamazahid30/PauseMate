PauseMate is a productivity and wellness application built using Electron. It helps users take regular breaks to improve their posture, reduce eye strain, and maintain overall well-being while working on a computer.

Problem Statement
In today's digital age, people spend long hours working on computers, often forgetting to take breaks. This can lead to:

Poor posture and back pain.
Eye strain due to prolonged screen exposure.
Reduced productivity and mental fatigue.
PauseMate addresses this problem by reminding users to take short breaks at regular intervals. It displays a fullscreen "blocker screen" to encourage users to pause, relax, and stretch.
